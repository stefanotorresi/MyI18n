MyI18n
===

MyI18n is a Zend Framework 2 module based on [Matt Cockayne](https://github.com/zucchi)'s [ZucchiLocale](https://github.com/zucchi/ZucchiLocale).

DISCLAIMER: This is one of my first ZF2 modules so it probably has a lot of rough edges. I didn't fork the original project because I didn't really knew where to go from there, I just needed to mock about with a simple module.
